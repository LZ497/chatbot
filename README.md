# Chatbot

We implemented the chatbot's three main functions: text, image, and voice. Deploy Textbot and Imagebot using Flask. Audiobot is based on NVIDIA Omniverse. 

## Deployment

**Text Version** 
As we have installed Flask, we create [app.py](app.py) file to generate routes for our web application, take input from HTML form and return response after processing chatbot. 

We add two features, text and image, in [chatbot.py](chatbot.py) file, and optimize [index.html](templates/index.html) to perform different actions based on different input conditions. 

The most important thing is that Flask loads the generated image saved under the [static](static/) folder. 

With all settled, we need to run the flask app using ``` python app.py ```. 

If everything goes right, go to â€“ ``` http://localhost:5000/ ``` and enjoy chatbot.

**Audio Version** 
Download Omniverse Laucher to install Audio2Face(2021.3.2) library. 

Open the app and a Demo Streaming Audio Scene where everything is already configured. 

Keep the Audio2Face demo processing and open audiobot.ipynb file through Omniverse Laucher settings. 

Execute codes and the Audiobot is ready to talk with you.
